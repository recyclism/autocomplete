Autocomplete
Autocomplete emulates your mouse and keyboard. The software (built with Max/Msp), moves the userâ€™s mouse to the Spotlight area, searches for Safari, opens the application, starts a new tab, types "www.google.com," and writes search queries randomly from a database which are then autocompleted by the Google Autocomplete function.

Autocomplete predictions are algorithmically determined based on a number of factors (including popularity of search terms) without any human intervention. Just like the web, the search queries presented may include silly or strange or surprising terms and phrases. While we always strive to reflect the diversity of content on the web (some good, some objectionable), we also apply a narrow set of removal policies for things like pornography, violence, hate speech, and terms that are frequently used to find content that infringes copyrights.
